<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>The database is designed to be used by anybody with a web browser or a phone application. Our database tracks recipes and ingredients and provides nutritional information about each and possible recipes for a given set of ingredients. This application will also help your weight goals whether it is to put on muscle mass or lose weight.

Calorie specific meals means the database keeps track of all of the nutritional values, whether it is looking for foods with a higher concentration of vitamin c or a gluten free specific food. 

The users of this database will include people of three spectrums, people who are trying to restrict or increase the amount of calories they intake, people who want to make a recipe for a certain price point and people who want to find nutritious recipes given certain foods. 

The user interface of the application will have options for the users in the way they want to use the application. The options are Calorie Tracker, Recipe Builder, Food budgeting.

The User interface will have a Recipe builder option and ask the user for what kinds of foods they would like to make. After inputting what foods they want, the application will return results of various recipes that can be made using those foods. It will have an option to list dietary restrictions and will exclude this from the results. 

Calorie tracker the user will enter a goal weight and deadline of how fast they want to achieve the desired weight. We will prescribe a daily calorie count based on the length of your goal and the amount you want to gain or lose. 

Food Budgeting, the user will type in the budget and the foods they need and it will return recipes or meals at or below that budget.
